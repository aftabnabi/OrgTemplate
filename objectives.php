					 WFCL Project - Objectives and Targets
				</div>
			 
				<p style="margin:10px;">
                The Government of Punjab in the Labour and Human Resource Department intends to undertake a 5 year project (2011-16) for elimination of worst forms of child labour in 4 districts of Punjab, namely Chakwal, Jhelum, Jhang and Layyah, as a pilot project potentially replicable throughout the province.</p>
				<p style="margin:10px;">
Based on interactions with stakeholders, a comprehensive review of the existing literature on child labour and its worst forms in Pakistan and globally and in light of the experience of ILO and other organisations in Pakistan, the project proposes a set of activities that are necessary to address the root causes of hazardous and worst forms of child labour. It includes ways and means to improve the access to social services for the children engaged in hazardous child labour and provision of some form of social or financial protection to the families of these children. The project also includes strategies to effectively link target families with the social service provided by the government, such as education, health, skill training. The project will also attempt to establish model workplaces free of hazards to safety and health, where young persons of legal age can learn the skills and work in safe manner and adults can work more productively. Although the scope of this project is limited to 4 districts, but the interventions are potentially replicable to other districts and sectors.
</p> 
 
<p style="margin:10px;">The project proposes a holistic strategy and consists of a set of administrative arrangements and direct interventions. The list of implementation mechanism and the interventions is given below.</p>

<ul class="objectiveUL" style="list-style:none">
<li>Recruitment of professional staff to oversee the implementation arrangements of WFCL project.</li>
<li>Establishment of District Coordination Committees(DCCs) in the target districts to coordinate the project interventions in the respective districts.</li>
<li>Baseline or rapid assessment surveys to assess the geographic and sectoral dimensions of worst forms of child labour in the respective districts.</li>
<li><span>Establishment of non-formal education and literacy centers in the clusters where majority of target children (age below 18 year) and their siblings</span>&nbsp;<br/><span style="margin-left:6%"> prone to WFCL can be enrolled.</span></li>
